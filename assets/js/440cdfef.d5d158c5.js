The stringent requirements for performance, power, area, and cost (PPAC) in modern complex designs, which can include up to billions of transistors, make hardware design increasingly demanding compared to earlier generations. These challenges result in longer turnaround times (TAT) for optimizing PPAC during RTL synthesis, simulation, verification, physical design, and reliability processes.\nIn this talk, we introduce multi-AI agents built on top of AutoGen to improve efficiency and reduce TAT in the chip design process. The talk explores the integration of novel distilled knowledge debugging graphs, task graph solving, and multimodal capabilities within multi-AI agents to address tasks such as timing debugging, Verilog debugging, and Design Rule Check (DRC) code generation. Based on these studies, multi-AI agents demonstrate promising improvements in performance, productivity, and efficiency in chip design."}),"\n",(0,t.jsxs)(n.h3,{id:"sign-up--httpsdiscordgg8wfkcvn2event1300487847681196082",children:["Sign Up:  ",(0,t.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://discord.gg/8WFKcVN2?event=1300487847681196082",children:"https://discord.gg/8WFKcVN2?event=1300487847681196082"})]}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"integrating-foundation-models-and-symbolic-computing-for-next-generation-robot-planning---nov-18-2024",children:"Integrating Foundation Models and Symbolic Computing for Next-Generation Robot Planning - Nov 18, 2024"}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.h3,{id:"speakers-yongchao-chen",children:"Speakers: Yongchao Chen"}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.h3,{id:"biography-of-the-speakers-1",children:"Biography of the speakers:"}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Yongchao Chen is a PhD student of Electrical Engineering at Harvard SEAS and MIT LIDS.

By combining LLMs with symbolic planners and solvers, or guiding LLMs to generate code for planning, we enable them to address complex decision-making tasks for both real and virtual robots.
